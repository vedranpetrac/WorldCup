# WorldCup

College Project

The idea was to create three projects in charge of displaying statistics from the 2018 Men's World Cup.
and for women in 2019 using the following API: https://worldcup.sfg.io. 
The specified API predestinedly contains the results of the women's championship that was last played, and
archived results of the men's championship have the following URL: https://world-cup-json-2018.herokuapp.com.
The projects are as follows: a Windows Forms application, a Windows Presentation Foundation application, and a project in charge of
data manipulation "Data Layer" (Class Library - .NET Framework) used in both applications.
